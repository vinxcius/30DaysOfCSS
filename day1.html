                <p>"Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each kill she
                    scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.
                    Reyna has the passive ability of Soul Harvest, enemies killed by Reyna or her teammates leave behind
                    Soul Orbs that lasts 3 seconds"</p>
